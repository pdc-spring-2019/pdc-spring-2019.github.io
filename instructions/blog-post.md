# Posting to the Course Blog

Posting to the course blog is fairly straightforward, as it is an point-and-click process. Before attempting to post, follow instructions to create your blog at https://github.com/pdc-spring-2019/pdc-spring-2019.github.io/blob/master/instructions/course-blog.md if you haven't done so already.

1. Log into the site by going to https://pdc-spring-2019.matthew-lavin.com and clicking "login"
2. Enter your Github username and password if prompted and accept the terms of use
3. Click the link titled "Admin" and, under the student content submenu, click the link titled "Blog Post"
4. Fill out all required fields, including your post in the "Body" field. Use the WYSIWYG editor or click "source" enter pure HTML. (Note that you can use Bootstrap3 classes such as ```<table class="table table-striped">``` to apply CSS styles to your blog.)
5. Under tags, click the text box. A list of available tags will appear. Choose the "Introductions" tag from the list
6. If you'd like to include an image, upload a .jpg or .png to Github and use an absolute path to that file in your tag, like this: ```<img src="https://github.com/pdc-spring-2019/pdc-spring-2019.github.io/blob/master/instructions/menu-link.png?raw=true">```. For more info on absolute paths to Github files, look at [this tutorial](https://www.labnol.org/internet/free-file-hosting-github/29092/). 
7. When you are finished writing, click "save" and go to your blog to verify that your post is now published.
